üß† Workshop Overview for instructor: AI for Academic‚ÄìIndustry Collaboration
üî∑ Workshop Summary
This workshop is designed to train students, academic researchers, and industry professionals on how to use AI tools and structured prompt engineering to improve collaboration between universities and industry. It focuses specifically on grant writing, research productivity, and applied use cases across different domains.

The workshop incorporates hands-on activities, real-world use cases, and a guided walkthrough of a prototype platform that recommends AI tools and prompts based on specific collaboration scenarios. It leverages tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Dimensions.ai, Grantable.ai, and is supported by a custom-built prompt library.

üìö What the Workshop Includes
1. Module-Based Learning
Module 1: Introduction to AI in Research Collaboration

Module 2: Prompt Engineering Techniques (ICE, RCR, Chain-of-Thought)

Module 3: AI Tool Comparison (ChatGPT vs. Claude)

Module 4: Using Prompts in Grant Writing and Research

Module 5: Real-World Use Case Simulations

2. Hands-On Exercises
Prompt writing using real academic/industry scenarios

Tool testing: How different prompts perform in ChatGPT vs. Claude

Writing grants, abstracts, partnership emails, and research proposals with AI

Prompt refinement: adjusting tone, structure, temperature, etc.

3. Resource Pack
Prompt templates by task and sector

Cheat sheets for each prompt engineering framework

Quick-start guides for using ChatGPT, Claude, Dimensions.ai

Sample proposal templates, project briefs, and outreach drafts

4. Assessments
Pre-Workshop Survey: Gauge baseline AI familiarity

Post-Workshop Survey: Measure learning gains and user confidence

Optional: AI output evaluation task (how accurate/useful was the generated content?)

ü§ù How the Workshop Benefits Collaboration
‚úÖ 1. Bridges Communication Gaps
Helps academics translate technical language into clear, industry-ready content.

Supports industry partners in understanding academic goals and contributions.

Enables more effective conversations around research value, impact, and outcomes.

‚úÖ 2. Accelerates Grant Writing and Proposal Success
Participants learn to auto-generate or improve grant drafts using AI.

Aligns proposals with funding body language, structure, and keywords.

Reduces time spent on repetitive writing while maintaining professional standards.

‚úÖ 3. Improves Research Output and Visibility
Prompts help researchers write abstracts, summarize papers, or identify research gaps quickly.

Encourages better use of AI for literature reviews, idea validation, and knowledge sharing.

Helps students and staff work more efficiently across levels of complexity.

‚úÖ 4. Enables More Informed Tool Selection
Participants learn which AI tools suit specific tasks (e.g., Claude for strategic planning, ChatGPT for quick content generation).

Users gain confidence in trying new tools beyond generic usage.

‚úÖ 5. Supports Scalable Training & Onboarding
Designed for all levels‚Äîbeginner to advanced.

Offers reusable templates, cheat sheets, and evaluation rubrics.

Facilitates long-term AI adoption within institutions.
