 User Story – Student Persona in AI-Driven Collaboration
📌 What is a User Story?
A user story is a short, simple description of a user, their goals, and what they need to accomplish — often written from the user’s point of view. In AI collaboration projects, user stories help define how different types of users interact with AI tools, and what kind of support they require.
