Summarize what we need: Generate a 250-word abstract for a co-authored paper on using AI to optimize energy use in buildings.

What specifics: Mention research novelty, industrial partner's role, data model used, and expected outcome.

Avoids: Too much focus on academic theory.

Results be like: “This study explores…” to “Results suggest…” structure.

Any other detail: Use RCR format to maintain structure.

Citation: Based on IEEE/Elsevier abstract guidelines.

Reason: Helps generate high-quality, publish-ready abstracts quickly.

🔹 Prompt: Partner Mapping for Research Collaboration – Smart Cities (Beginner/Staff)
Summarize what we need: Identify 5 companies suitable for university collaboration on smart mobility.

What specifics: Company name, relevance, collaboration history, country, sector.

Avoids: Companies with no innovation arm or government focus only.

Results be like:
| Company | Sector | Fit Reason | Previous Research Ties |

Any other detail: Use Crunchbase + Dimensions.ai to validate.
