Reason: Helps users identify realistic funding options for collaborative work.

🔹 Prompt: Grant Proposal Draft – Climate AI Tool (Intermediate)
Summarize what we need: Draft a 500-word proposal for an AI platform that reduces carbon emissions in textile manufacturing.

What specifics: Problem, objectives, method, industrial role, and SDG alignment.

Avoids: Overuse of buzzwords or generic project goals.

Results be like: Structured proposal sections with clear value for industry.

Any other detail: Include mutual benefit between university and company.

Citation: Sample structures from Grantable.ai or EU Horizon templates.

Reason: Speeds up initial proposal drafting with clear collaborative framing.

🔹 Prompt: Research Gap Identification – Smart Cities (Advanced)
Summarize what we need: Identify a gap in AI for smart mobility, and propose a project idea to address it.

What specifics: Include background, hypothesis, method, and KPIs.

Avoids: Repeating existing solutions without new angles.

Results be like: A novel project idea suitable for grant applications.

Any other detail: Based on analysis of recent papers from Dimensions.ai (2020–2024).

Citation: Cite real papers via Dimensions.ai > Smart Cities + AI + Mobility.

🔹 Prompt: Abstract for Joint Research Paper – Sustainability & AI (Intermediate)
Summarize what we need: Generate a 250-word abstract for a co-authored paper on using AI to optimize energy use in buildings.

What specifics: Mention research novelty, industrial partner's role, data model used, and expected outcome.

Avoids: Too much focus on academic theory.

Results be like: “This study explores…” to “Results suggest…” structure.

Any other detail: Use RCR format to maintain structure.

Citation: Based on IEEE/Elsevier abstract guidelines.

Reason: Helps generate high-quality, publish-ready abstracts quickly.

🔹 Prompt: Partner Mapping for Research Collaboration – Smart Cities (Beginner/Staff)
Summarize what we need: Identify 5 companies suitable for university collaboration on smart mobility.

What specifics: Company name, relevance, collaboration history, country, sector.

Avoids: Companies with no innovation arm or government focus only.

Results be like:
| Company | Sector | Fit Reason | Previous Research Ties |

Any other detail: Use Crunchbase + Dimensions.ai to validate.
